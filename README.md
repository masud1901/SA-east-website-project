## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (version 1.22 or later)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masud1901/SA-east-website-project
   ```

   Replace `your-username` and `your-repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Move into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the project dependencies using npm or Yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Development Server

After installing the dependencies, start the development server to view the project in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the landing page.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized build of the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the production-ready files.
